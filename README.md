# Project Title: Themed Animation Creator

## Description

Themed Animation Creator is a Python application designed to generate custom, themed animations. Users can input text, select a theme, and the script generates a GIF animation with styled text transitions and background effects tailored to the chosen theme. Themes include Nintendo, Rainbow, Acid, and Original, each offering a unique visual experience.

## Features

- **Custom Text Inputs**: Add a title and subtitle to personalize your animation.
- **Theme Selection**: Choose from predefined themes to style your animation.
- **Adjustable Frame Rate**: Configure the animation's frame rate.
- **Output Control**: Save the generated animation to a specified directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- ImageIO
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/themed-animation-creator.git
cd themed-animation-creator
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required packages**

```bash
pip install pillow imageio numpy
```

### Usage

1. **Prepare Your Assets**

- Place any required PNG images in the designated assets folder. For example, for the Nintendo theme, ensure you have the necessary Nintendo-themed PNGs in `pics/nintendo.png`.

2. **Configuration**

- Open the script in your preferred text editor.
- Modify the `TITLE`, `SUBTITLE`, and other parameters as required towards the top of the script.

3. **Running the Script**

Execute the script from the terminal:

```bash
python themed_animation_creator.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to select your theme and input any required information.

### Output

Animations will be saved in the `outputs` directory with the name format `<TITLE>.gif`.

## Customization

To customize themes or add new ones, refer to the theming section of the script. Theme-specific parameters like color palettes and transition effects can be modified directly in the code.
